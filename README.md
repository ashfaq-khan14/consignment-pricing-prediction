# Consignment Pricing Prediction


## Description

The Consignment Pricing Prediction project is a machine learning solution designed to predict pricing for consignment items. This repository contains the code and resources needed to train a pricing prediction model using historical consignment data.

## Features

- Machine learning model for consignment pricing prediction.
- Sample code to preprocess data, train the model, and make predictions.
- Jupyter notebooks for data exploration, model training, and evaluation.
- Example dataset for demonstration purposes.
- Data preprocessing scripts.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/consignment-pricing-prediction.git
   cd consignment-pricing-prediction
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Prepare your dataset:

   - Place your dataset in the `data` directory.
   - Modify data preprocessing scripts if necessary.

4. Explore and preprocess the data using the provided Jupyter notebooks.

5. Train the pricing prediction model:

   ```bash
   python train.py --data_path data/train.csv --model_output model.pkl
   ```

6. Make predictions using the trained model:

   ```python
   from model import ConsignmentPricingModel

   model = ConsignmentPricingModel.load_model('model.pkl')
   new_data = load_new_data()  # Replace with your data loading code
   predictions = model.predict(new_data)
   print(predictions)
   ```

7. Check out the example notebooks for step-by-step guides on data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
